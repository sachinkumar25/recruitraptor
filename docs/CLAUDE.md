# CLAUDE.md

Rules:

##Standard Workflow
First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to tasks/todo.md.

The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them

Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.

Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.

Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made

Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.

Finally, add a review section to the todo.md file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information.





This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

# CLAUDE.md - AI Recruiter Agent Project Context

## Project Description

**AI Recruiter Agent** is a microservices-based system that automates candidate evaluation for technical recruiters. The system processes uploaded resumes, discovers candidate profiles across GitHub and LinkedIn, enriches the data with additional insights, and generates comprehensive candidate assessments using AI narrative generation.

**Core Workflow**: Resume Upload → Text Extraction → Field Parsing → Profile Discovery → Data Enrichment → LLM-Generated Assessment → Interactive Dashboard

**Target Users**: Technical recruiters who need to quickly evaluate software engineering candidates with consistent, detailed analysis.

**Business Value**: Reduces candidate screening time from 20+ minutes to under 1 minute while improving evaluation consistency and depth.

## Key Concepts and Terminology

### Domain Concepts
- **Candidate Profile**: Complete aggregated data about a job candidate from resume, GitHub, and LinkedIn
- **Confidence Scoring**: 0.0-1.0 reliability indicator for all extracted data fields
- **Profile Discovery**: Automated process of finding candidate's GitHub and LinkedIn profiles
- **Data Enrichment**: Process of combining resume data with external profile information
- **Narrative Assessment**: AI-generated candidate evaluation tailored to specific job requirements

### Technical Concepts
- **Processing Pipeline**: Sequential data flow through microservices (Parser → Discovery → Enrichment → Generation)
- **Field Extraction**: NLP-based parsing of resume text into structured data fields
- **Repository Analysis**: GitHub repository examination for technical skills and project quality
- **Skill Proficiency Estimation**: Algorithm that estimates candidate skill levels based on evidence
- **Cross-Reference Validation**: Verification of candidate data consistency across multiple sources

### Service Definitions
- **Resume Parser Service**: Extracts structured data from PDF/DOCX/TXT resume files
- **Profile Discovery Service**: Searches for and validates GitHub and LinkedIn profiles
- **Data Enrichment Service**: Combines data sources and performs skill analysis
- **Narrative Generation Service**: Creates AI-powered candidate assessments using LLMs
- **User Interface**: Web dashboard for file upload, data review, and report generation
