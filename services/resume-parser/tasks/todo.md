### Key Technical Features

1. **Robust File Processing**: Handles corrupted files, unsupported formats, and encoding issues
2. **NLP-Powered Extraction**: Uses spaCy for entity recognition and pattern matching
3. **Confidence Scoring**: Every extracted field includes a confidence score (0.0-1.0)
4. **Structured Logging**: Comprehensive logging with structlog for production monitoring
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with meaningful error messages
6. **Performance Monitoring**: Request timing and processing metrics
7. **Security**: File size limits, type validation, and trusted host middleware

### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/v1/upload` - Upload and parse resume files
- `GET /api/v1/health` - Service health check
- `GET /api/v1/supported-types` - Get supported file types and limits
- `GET /` - Service information

### Next Steps

1. **Install spaCy Model**: Run `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`
2. **Environment Setup**: Create `.env` file with configuration
3. **Docker Integration**: Add Dockerfile for containerization
4. **Production Deployment**: Configure for production environment
5. **Performance Optimization**: Add caching and async processing
6. **Enhanced Parsing**: Improve accuracy with more training data
7. **Integration Testing**: Test with real resume files

### Usage Example

```bash
# Start the service
cd ai-recruiter-agent/services/resume-parser
python -m resume_parser.main

# Test with curl
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/upload" \
     -H "accept: application/json" \
     -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
     -F "file=@resume.pdf"
```

The Resume Parser service is now fully implemented and ready for integration with the AI Recruiter Agent system!
